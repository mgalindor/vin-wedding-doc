# Markdown Formatting Guidelines
- Do not include by default line separator Eg. `---` in markdown documents, only when explicitly required by the template or instructions.

# Documentation Front Matter
- All markdown project documentation files must include a YAML front matter header at the top of the document enclosed by `---` lines
- The front matter should include the following fields:
  - `title`: A clear and descriptive title of the document
  - `date`: The date when the document was created or last updated (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `type`: The type of document See [Document types](#document-types)
  - `scope`: The intended audience for the document (e.g., public, client, internal)

# Tasks
- When creating tasks, actionable activities or action items in any documents, use the following format:
`- [ ] Task description here`
- This format creates a checkbox that can be marked as completed when the task is done. For example:
`- [X] Schedule follow-up meeting with the client` indicates that the task has been completed, while `- [ ] Schedule follow-up meeting with the client` indicates that the task is still pending.
- Tasks can contains additional metadata in the next format `[metadata:: metadata-value]` for example:
`- [ ] Schedule follow-up meeting with the client [priority:: high] [due:: 2024-07-01]` indicates that the task has a high priority and is due by July 1, 2024.
- Common metadata fields include (**Very important not all fields are required.Only use when required**) :
  - `priority`: low, medium, high
  - `owner`: name or email or company name of the person responsible for the task
  - `due`: YYYY-MM-DD format date for when the task is due
  - `created`: YYYY-MM-DD format date for when the task was created
  - `completion`: YYYY-MM-DD format date for when the task was completed
  - `start`: YYYY-MM-DD format date for when the task is started
  - `scheduled`: YYYY-MM-DD format date for when the task is scheduled
- **Very important:** Mark tasks as completed by changing the checkbox from `[ ]` to `[X]` and adding the completion date in the metadata exactly after was completed, for example:
`- [X] Schedule follow-up meeting with the client [due:: 2024-07-01] [completion:: 2024-06-30]` indicates that the task was completed on June 30, 2024.
